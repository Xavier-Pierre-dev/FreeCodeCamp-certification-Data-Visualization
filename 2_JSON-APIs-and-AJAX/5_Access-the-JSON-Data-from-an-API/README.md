<p>In the previous challenge, you saw how to get JSON data from the freeCodeCamp Cat Photo API.</p>
<p>Now you'll take a closer look at the returned data to better understand the JSON format. Recall some notation in JavaScript:</p>
<blockquote>[ ] -&gt; Square brackets represent an array.<br/>{ } -&gt; Curly brackets represent an object.<br/>" " -&gt; Double quotes represent a string. They are also used for key names in JSON.</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the structure of the data that an API returns is important because it influences how you retrieve the values you need.</p>
<p>On the right, click the <code>Get Message</code> button to load the freeCodeCamp Cat Photo API JSON into the HTML.</p>
<p>The first and last character you see in the JSON data are square brackets <code>[ ]</code>. This means that the returned data is an array. The second character in the JSON data is a curly <code>{</code> bracket, which starts an object. Looking closely, you can see that there are three separate objects. The JSON data is an array of three objects, where each object contains information about a cat photo.</p>
<p>You learned earlier that objects contain "key-value pairs" that are separated by commas. In the Cat Photo example, the first object has <code>"id":0</code> where <code>id</code> is a key and <code>0</code> is its corresponding value. Similarly, there are keys for <code>imageLink</code>, <code>altText</code>, and <code>codeNames</code>. Each cat photo object has these same keys, but with different values.</p>
<p>Another interesting "key-value pair" in the first object is <code>"codeNames":["Juggernaut","Mrs. Wallace","ButterCup"]</code>. Here <code>codeNames</code> is the key and its value is an array of three strings. It's possible to have arrays of objects as well as a key with an array as a value.</p>
<p>Remember how to access data in arrays and objects. Arrays use bracket notation to access a specific index of an item. Objects use either bracket or dot notation to access the value of a given property. Here's an example that prints the <code>altText</code> property of the first cat photo - note that the parsed JSON data in the editor is saved in a variable called <code>json</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-js" tabindex="0"><code class="language-js">console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>json<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>altText<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The console would display the string <code>A white cat wearing a green helmet shaped melon on its head.</code>.</p>
</section></div><hr/><div><section id="instructions">
<p>For the cat with the <code>id</code> of 2, print to the console the second value in the <code>codeNames</code> array. You should use bracket and dot notation on the object (which is saved in the variable <code>json</code>) to access the value.</p>
