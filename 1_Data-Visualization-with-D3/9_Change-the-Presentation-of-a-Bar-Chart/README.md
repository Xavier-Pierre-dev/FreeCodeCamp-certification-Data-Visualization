<p>The last challenge created a bar chart, but there are a couple of formatting changes that could improve it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add space between each bar to visually separate them, which is done by adding a margin to the CSS for the <code>bar</code> class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the height of the bars to better show the difference in values, which is done by multiplying the value by a number to scale the height</p>

<p>First, add a <code>margin</code> of <code>2px</code> to the <code>bar</code> class in the <code>style</code> tag. Next, change the callback function in the <code>style()</code> method so it returns a value <code>10</code> times the original data value (plus the <code>px</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Multiplying each data point by the <em>same</em> constant only alters the scale. It's like zooming in, and it doesn't change the meaning of the underlying data.</p>
