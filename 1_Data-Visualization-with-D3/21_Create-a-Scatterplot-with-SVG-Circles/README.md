<p>A scatter plot is another type of visualization. It usually uses circles to map data points, which have two values each. These values tie to the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes, and are used to position the circle in the visualization.</p>
<p>SVG has a <code>circle</code> tag to create the circle shape. It works a lot like the <code>rect</code> elements you used for the bar chart.</p>
