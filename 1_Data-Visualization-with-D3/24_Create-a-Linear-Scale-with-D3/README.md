<p>The bar and scatter plot charts both plotted data directly onto the SVG canvas. However, if the height of a bar or one of the data points were larger than the SVG height or width values, it would go outside the SVG area.</p>
<p>In D3, there are scales to help plot data. <code>scales</code> are functions that tell the program how to map a set of raw data points onto the pixels of the SVG canvas.</p>
<p>For example, say you have a 100x500-sized SVG canvas and you want to plot Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for a number of countries. The set of numbers would be in the billion or trillion-dollar range. You provide D3 a type of scale to tell it how to place the large GDP values into that 100x500-sized area.</p>
<p>It's unlikely you would plot raw data as-is. Before plotting it, you set the scale for your entire data set, so that the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values fit your canvas width and height.</p>
<p>D3 has several scale types. For a linear scale (usually used with quantitative data), there is the D3 method <code>scaleLinear()</code>:</p>

<p>By default, a scale uses the identity relationship. The value of the input is the same as the value of the output. A separate challenge covers how to change this.</p>
